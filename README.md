I believe that great design is observable in our every day life, especially in nature. I am **web designer, visual artist, and graphic artist**.I have been painting for over six years and have exhibited my artwork throughout the United States. I also have a background in Environmental Science and English. I'm always looking to expand my work and learn more about web development and computer programming. My goal as a web developer is to explore and create new experiences that are dynamic and engaging for the user using a variety of tools and frameworks.

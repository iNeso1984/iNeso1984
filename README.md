I am web designer, visual artist, and graphic artist residing in Jacksonville, FL. I have been painting for over six years and have exhibited my artwork throughout the United States. I also have a background in Environmental Science and English. I'm always looking to expand my work and learn as a web designer and visual artist. I enjoy combining animation and graphics with UI experiences. My goal as a designer is to create experiences that are dynamic and engaging for the user. You can check out my artist website at www.vanessawithun.com and my graphic design website at https://vanessa555withun.myportfolio.com/.
